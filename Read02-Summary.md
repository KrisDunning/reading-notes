# Coder's Computer Summary

The terminal is also known as the command line interface(CLI). There are many wrappers available for a terminal to make the user experience better. You can have more than one terminal open at once, doing different things even. To navigate the terminal a few basic commands can be used that allow you to move between folder/directories. You can view file information such as filetype, size, date created etc. To see more complete information please see my notes page about terminals.
