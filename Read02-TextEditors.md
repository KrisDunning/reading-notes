# Text Editors

Text editors are a program that can be used to createand edit text files. There are some that are keyboard only and some that allow use of mouse inputs. Some may be have more features but may not be suited for coding. Microsoft Word for example allows text editing and also images and fancy formatting. These are nice features but not ones so useful for coding. IDE's (integrated development environment) are the next step up from text editors. They allow the combination of text editing with a GUI (graphical user interface) along with tools to enhance the software engineers ability to produce code effectively. Things such as code highlighting and error handling just to name a few. I would suggest doing some research to find one to suit your needs but feel free to start with some common ones such as Notepadd++, Atom or VSCode.
