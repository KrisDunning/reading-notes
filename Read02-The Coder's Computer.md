Here is a summary of what to look for in a text editor.


## Terminal Cheatsheet  

A shell is a wrapper for the terminal, with a common shell being *Bash*. We are currently using ohmyzsh as our shell.  
**PWD** - print working directory - displays your current directory.  
**ls** - list - lists items within current directory. 

**File Paths**   
- Absolute - /home/user/documents  
- Relative - /documents  
- tilde(~) - shortcut for home path  
- dot(.) - reference to current directory  
- double dot(..) - reference to parent directory  

**Navigation**
- cd - change directory (use tab to auto complete a partial destination name)
- file - use file\[filename] to determine the file type/extension
- case sensitivity - Linux is case sensitive. File1.txt and file.txt are different. So are file.TXT and file.txt.
- spaces in names - use escape character\[\\] before the space or put name in single quote \['file name']
- hidden files/folders - If name starts with a dot(.) then it is hidden. to find hidden use (ls -a) command
