Hello my name is Kris Dunning and I am an aspiring Web Developer based out of Seattle, WA. I am currently attending a [***Code Fellows***](https://codefellows.org "Code Fellows Home Page") bootcamp for full-stack web development. I attended North Seattle Community College and received two Associate of Science degrees in Electronics 
Technology and Sustainable Power and Distribution. To see my current progress please feel free to check out my [github profile](https://github.com/KrisDunning "Kris Dunning's

## Growth Mindset

The growth mindset to me is about making progress and not focusing on being perfect. Incremental growth adds up over time and like many other things
it takes focus, determination and hard work. I wouldn't go out and run a marathon without any training and I'm *probably* not gonna create the next Door Dash app
on my first try. I have experienced many things in my life that I never thought I would, and I learned many lessons about appreciating the value of those
experiences.  

> "It is never too late to be who you might have been" - *Gerorge Elliot*

I'm looking forward to learning and growing for the rest of my life. There is no end goal, just my next goal-- Be better tomorrow than I am today. <br>
Here are a few ways to for me to stay focused on my growth :
1. Do something every day! No excuses. 
    - 30 minutes of physical exercise
    - 30 minutes of mental exercise
2. Make a schedule so that you and your family can set appropriate expectations
3. Use available resources. Classmates, teachers, friends, online documents and the library.
